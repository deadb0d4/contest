# Contest problem solving rules

**Read the prompt.** You should have a _clear_ understanding of:
1. What do you have to do?
1. What is an input?
1. What is an output?
1. What are constraints?
1. Why are example test cases correct?

**Use an example**. It is essential to get at least one _good_ example test case.

**Create an idea**. Collect everything you can notice and observe. Get a _transparent_ idea of solution.

**Attack your idea**. Is there a formal proof of correctness? Is there a counterexample?

**Think before coding**. Spend at least 2 minutes thinking what _exactly_ to code.

**Drop a problem if stuck**. Consider skipping after 15 minutes with no progress at all.
